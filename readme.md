Plan for the 2 weeks.

1. Finish with XOR training in torch using ReLU and without ReLU.
- what I want to receive from XOR training is just understanding why activations matter.
2. Train Wan 2.2 to understnad the audio. -> apply framepack idea of infinity generation ->

[ ] Transformers architecture fully explained. 
[ ] Clip and ViT same thing.
[ ] DiT same thing.
[ ] What is used in Video generation models?



3. Understand and implement Gemma_architecture from transformers.
4. GRPO -> GSPO -> ? GSPO on vision
5. DPO + APO or something like that
6. How to do integration of ViT + AudioEncoder properly to the LLMs.
7. Understnad their architecture from very low level. (https://huggingface.co/bosonai/higgs-audio-v2-generation-3B-base)
